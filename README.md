The aim of this project is to develop a unified, cloud-based HMS that simplifies and enhances the management of hospital operations including appointment scheduling, access to medical records, and billing processes. Utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS), this system will be built to support the fluctuating demands of contemporary healthcare facilities with a scalable and dependable infrastructure.

Hospital management system is designed as a cutting-edge digital solution aimed at optimizing healthcare operations. It seamlessly integrates a suite of powerful AWS services, utilizes Docker for containerization, and employs Python Flask and HTML for application development.

**Supporting Technologies:**

●	Python Flask: This micro web framework is used for server-side code, offering simplicity and flexibility in designing and scaling web applications.

●	HTML/CSS: Used for crafting the front-end of the application, ensuring it is both functional and user-friendly for varying user roles such as patients, doctors, and administrators.

●	MongoDB: A NoSQL database utilized for its high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It is hosted on EC2 instances, forming the backbone for data storage and management.

●	Docker: Provides a standardized unit of software, packaging up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

●	GitHub and GitHub Actions: Employed for version control and CI/CD automation, these tools facilitate streamlined development workflows and collaboration.
